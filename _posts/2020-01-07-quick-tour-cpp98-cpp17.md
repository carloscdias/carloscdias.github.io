Wait, no more `new`? Wtf is `auto`? `constexpr`?! Why so many keywords?? Dafuq do they do?!
What the hell happened with C++ since college?


## The good old days of C++98

So, what nobody told me is this, the C++ we learn in college is actually a set of rules stablished by ISO Standard of 98,
in which we have templates, our beloved STL with common containers and algorithms, string, I/O streams, among other things.

The important thing is **C++ is NOT static**. It does, in fact, apply to any other programming language. The language changes
in order to adapt to new concepts, challenges, problems. Like we all do.

If you are like me and started programming in other languages to follow the necessity of the market and now you are trying
to code in C++ again, for fun or business, you may have a hard time with the new concepts that arrived to the language since then.


## So, what's changed?

Well... a lot! But let's focus on a subset of things that you will most probably use while programming in C++ again.

- introduce new features briefly: shared_ptr, unique_ptr, auto, cosntexpr, decltype, lamba functions...
